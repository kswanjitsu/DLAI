# This is a parser for the entirety of UMLS
'parse_umls.ipynb' a custom notebook that builds the basis of our corpus.  
It relies heavily on the RAPIDS AI cuDF packages. You should ensure the environment is setup properly to work with the notebook.
There is extensive documentation in the notebook itself, so look to that file for further details.

In the "old scripts" folder, you will find an alternative method to parsing out UMLS to build the corpus.  
This relies on the python package pymedtermino2.
